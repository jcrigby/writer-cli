# Product Requirements Document: Writer CLI

## Executive Summary

Writer CLI is a command-line interface tool that brings AI-powered writing assistance directly to the terminal. Built as a fork of Google's Writer CLI, it transforms the general-purpose AI tool into a specialized writing environment supporting multiple AI models through OpenRouter, with features specifically designed for creative and technical writers.

## Problem Statement

Writers currently face fragmentation in their toolchain:
- AI assistance requires switching between terminal and web interfaces
- No unified tool for manuscript organization, version control, and AI assistance
- Existing writing software lacks deep AI integration
- Version control systems aren't optimized for manuscript tracking
- Multi-model AI access requires managing multiple subscriptions and interfaces

## Solution Overview

Writer CLI provides a unified command-line environment that combines:
- Multi-model AI assistance (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) through OpenRouter
- Project-based manuscript organization
- Git-optimized version control for writers
- Context-aware writing assistance that remembers characters and plot
- Export capabilities for publishing formats
