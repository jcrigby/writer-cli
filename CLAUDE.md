# Project: Writer's CLI Companion

## Project Overview

A writer-focused CLI tool built on the Gemini CLI foundation, designed to provide Claude's full writing capabilities while streamlining the creative writing workflow. This tool bridges the gap between Claude's web interface and a writer's need for robust file management, version control, and project organization.

## Core Vision

**"Claude in your terminal, optimized for writers"**

Bring the full power of Claude's writing assistance directly to your writing environment with:
- Seamless integration with your existing writing tools
- Git-based project management for manuscripts
- Chapter/scene organization and navigation
- Revision tracking and manuscript versioning
- Research and world-building management
- Export capabilities for various publishing formats

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Incremental Processing**: Only analyze changed sections
- **Smart Caching**: Cache character and world-building data
- **Lazy Loading**: Load project data as needed
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking git operations

### Security and Privacy
- **Local-First**: All writing stays on your machine
- **Encrypted Backups**: Secure cloud synchronization
- **API Key Security**: Safe storage of credentials
- **Privacy Controls**: Opt-in data sharing for improvements

## Competitive Analysis

### Advantages Over Existing Tools
- **AI Integration**: Native Claude assistance vs. afterthought plugins
- **Version Control**: Git-native vs. proprietary versioning
- **Cross-Platform**: Terminal-based vs. platform-specific apps
- **Extensible**: Open source vs. closed ecosystems
- **Cost Effective**: Pay-per-use API vs. monthly subscriptions

### Differentiation from Web Claude
- **File Management**: Direct manuscript manipulation
- **Project Context**: Persistent story and character awareness
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple chapters simultaneously
- **Offline Capability**: Work without internet connection
- **Integration**: Connect with existing writing toolchain

This writer's CLI companion would transform how writers interact with AI assistance, making it a natural part of their creative workflow while maintaining the professionalism and organization needed for serious writing projects.
